It has a simple design where you can look up books or words in a dictionary, powered by two APIs for a more comprehensive search.

Stylish Look: Uses a Orbitron font with a calm lilac and grey color theme. It's clean, modern and easy on the eyes.

Smart Search Areas: There are special parts for finding books and words, with these two APIs working in the background. They pop up when you need them, thanks to some clever behind-the-scenes work.

Cool Search Bar and Buttons: The search box and buttons are wide, easy to use, and look great with rounded edges. They even change color when you hover over them.

Your Own Book Section: There's a spot just for your book collection. It's like having your own little digital bookshelf.

It's a handy, stylish tool for all your book and word searches, enhanced by the integration of two APIs. It's like a mini-librarian in your phone! ðŸ“šâœ¨
